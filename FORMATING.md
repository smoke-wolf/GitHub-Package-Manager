# Formatting Laws 
1. PEP 8 Compliance
Follow the PEP 8 style guide for code formatting, including indentation, line length, and naming conventions. Use tools like flake8 or pylint to check for compliance.

2. Indentation
Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not mix spaces and tabs for indentation.

3. Maximum Line Length
Limit each line to a maximum of 79 characters. For docstrings or comments, you can go up to 72 characters.

4. Imports
Follow the recommended import order. Group imports by standard library modules, third-party packages, and local project modules. Separate each group with a blank line.

5. Blank Lines
Use blank lines sparingly to improve code readability. Separate functions, classes, and logical sections with a single blank line.

6. Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
Avoid extraneous whitespace in expressions and statements. For example, avoid spaces immediately inside parentheses, brackets, or before commas.

7. Naming Conventions
Follow the naming conventions defined in PEP 8 for variables, functions, classes, and modules. Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the entity.

8. Comments and Docstrings
Write clear and concise comments to explain complex code logic. Use docstrings to document modules, classes, functions, and methods.

9. Commit Titles
Write meaningful commit titles that summarize the purpose of the commit. Use present tense and a concise description (e.g., "Fix typo in README" or "Add user authentication feature").

10. Commit Messages
Provide detailed explanations in the commit message's body if necessary. Explain the problem, solution, and any relevant context. Reference issue numbers or pull requests if applicable.

11. Code Modularity
Keep functions and classes focused on a single responsibility. Avoid overly long functions or classes that perform multiple unrelated tasks.

12. Testing
Write unit tests for your code whenever possible. Use a testing framework like unittest or pytest. Ensure that tests cover edge cases and expected behaviors.

13. Virtual Environments
Use virtual environments (e.g., venv or conda) to isolate project dependencies. Include a requirements.txt file for easier dependency management.

14. Version Control
Follow the project's version control workflow, such as Git. Create feature branches for new work, and submit pull requests against the main branch.

15. Respect Project Guidelines
Adhere to any project-specific guidelines, conventions, or best practices in addition to these general formatting laws.

Remember, consistency is key to maintaining a readable and collaborative codebase. Following these guidelines will help ensure a smooth contribution process and enhance the overall quality of the project.
