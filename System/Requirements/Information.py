The Manual Cache Management feature enables users to interact with system function as well as their own data. 
Resulting changes to the MCM files will depend on the privilege of the user, as well as the source of the 
alteration. (System changes will be implemented in (System.Drive), whereas user changes will be implemented 
in (Cache.USER))

Changes to System Settings will be reflected on package functionality and will result in changes to the user 
experience. However, changes made to User Settings may not directly affect the experience of the user.
