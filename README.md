# Our Vision :stars:
GHPM is designed to be a straightforward app for anyone to streamline their GitHub experience. 

We are actively reviewing and monitoring suggestions whilst also working heavily on improving the user experience. 

Whilst GHPM is made up of a small inner core mainly led by **Smoke-Wolf**. We are quick to incorporate any needed improvements and bug fixes. 

Thus for we uphold a stable application with support and an active development team, we welcome new members to join and provide their skills to improve the experience for everyone.
